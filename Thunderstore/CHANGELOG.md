## 0.9.3

- Toy Robot Barrier 5 -> 6
- Zorse Pill
    - Starve Effect nolonger spawns when dealing any DoTs
    - Deals proper TOTAL damage
- Sonorous Pail
    - Now gives jump height per Lunar
    - Sonorous Pail no longer disables Bands nor VoidBear (this was actually happens with vanilla restacking, so I made my own method)
    - New restack doesn't regives items, therefore no longer synergizes with silver thread (used to be an immortality build with Sue's Mandables)
