## 0.9.2

- Toy Robot Barrier 5 -> 6
- Zorse Pill
    - Deals proper TOTAL damage
    - Starve Effect nolonger spawns when dealing any DoTs
- Sonorous Pail
    - Now gives jump height per Lunar
    - Sonorous Pail no longer disables Bands nor VoidBear (this was acutally a problem with vanilla restacking, so I just wrote a better restack method)
    - New restack method no longer regives items, therefore nolonger synergizes with silver thread (used to be an immortality build with Sue's Mandables)
