	When Testing:
- Test Frisbee (2nd Player)
- Test HMT double pot explosion

	ToDo Next:
- Test Balance
- Add Equipments
- Add 3d Models

	My Item Add Order:
- Seismograph
- Tipped Arrow
- Tungston Rod
- Trebuchet
- Worm Holes
- Pet Rock
- Jelly Jail

	For Future Consideration:
- Univeersal Solute doesn't dissolve dead players
- Add force to Xenon amploue
- Actually fix Silver Thread and Sonorous Pail Problem (doesn't work if player has the same or fewer number of an item compared to silver)
- Add VFX:
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
	- Ice Cubes
	- Pot of Regolith
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
	- RAM
	- CremeBrulee
	- RottenBones
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Change vault items use run instance instead of Item Catalog (for if items are banned in a run)
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- HMT with Shared Design (Perfect Elite) causes infinte loop?


	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Should Scissors count how many scraps to give and give all at once?
	(reduced jank and reduced synergy with thread)
- Should Scissors cut Tonic Affliction
- Should Vault and Coffin only break on next stage and not on death? How about Candles?
- Should Grape drop chance be affected by luck, or the whole item be unaffected by luck?
