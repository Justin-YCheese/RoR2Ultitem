	When Testing:
- Test Sonorous Pail Jump Height
- Test Zorse Pill
- Test DamageType for Macrosiesmograph
- Multiplayer
	- Jealous Foe

	My Item Add Order:
- Tipped Arrow
- Tungston Rod
- Trebuchet
- Worm Holes
- Pet Rock
- Jelly Jail


	For Future Consideration:
- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)
- Yield Sign can reduce your speed when using speed mode (because displacement greater than max speed)
- change Yield Attack from will o' wisp to blast attack
- If jumping with Chrysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
- RockyTaffy's Shield doesn't contribute to Transcendence
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add VFX:

	- Pot of Regolith
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
	- RAM
	- CremeBrulee
	- RottenBones
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- HMT with Shared Design (Perfect Elite) causes infinte loop?
- 

	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Should Grape drop chance be affected by luck, or the whole item be unaffected by luck?
- Should Scissors cut Tonic Affliction?
