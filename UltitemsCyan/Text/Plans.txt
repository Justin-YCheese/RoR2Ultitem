	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Rename Viral Smog to Viral Cure? Viral Eessence? Viral Lilac?

	When Playing:
- Add jump buffer timer to Frisbee (because it's being janky, Test with Hunter's Harpoon)

	When Testing:
- Test Landing on quartz to reset jumps
- Rotten Bones works when time is frozen...
	- Because using Run.instance.time
- Check that Mythrixs can apply starve
- Test Obsolute in void fields and Newt shop Xenon Ampoule
- Test Tiny Igloo with Turrets
- Test All Items

	My Item Add Order:
- Resin Whirlpool
- Worm Holes
- Power Chips
- Trebuchet
- Jelly Jail

	When updating mod check:
- Bugs / Tests
- Version number (Ultitems Main / Manifest)
- Readme
- Update DLL and Bundle
- Update Manifest dependencies
- zip
- Has the tags: Mods | Items | Survivors of the Void | Seekers of the Storm Update



	For Future Consideration:
- If hit with flea bag greater than 200% double flea bag drop chance (now that crit is only x2)
- Make Pot of Regolith give lots of armor for a second after use
	- Or some other thing so it's like a parry in a way
- Blast showers on bandit has visual glitch? Doesn't appear and put on special (perhaps because I switched equipment after using)
- Make Tiny Igloo also increase size of
	- gilded money zone
		- (Works mechanicaly but dosen't change visually)
	- Healing wards
	- Count total igloos within specific zone? (so seperating stacks is okay?)

- Make Macroseismograph launch all characters the same way
	- Use Jellyfish explosion instead (and increase range) (or use both?)
- Transcendence, Taffy, Sue’s Mandibles
	- Doesn't work? Why?
- Test Threads
	- Offer to Rebirth check consumed items
- Flea Bag rework..
	- Too many drops when you have crits?
- See how many Jealous Foes does it takes to activate each on kill frenzy effect
	- Berserker's Pauldron, Resonant Disc, Chronic Expansion
- Add sound for losing Birthdyay Buff
- Change Rocky Taffy to only give buff at Full Heath?
- Should Dream Fuel use amuptated Max Health (how does it interact with the Shine of Soul)
- Rework Obsolute
	- For every item deleted, gain half a chest worth of gold
		- A full normal chest worth?
		- More gold for rarer items?		
		- Match roll of pennies method
		- Test with free chest lunar & war bonds
	- Make delete self when you have no items?
- Birthday Candle
	- Test New Birthday Candles with gaining several new Birthday Candles at a time
	- With 4 Birthday candles you have a 5:00, 5:20, 5:40, and 6:00 minute timer
	- Gaining 3 more should give the same lengths of timers (except 6:00)
		- Thus two buffs should be lost each interval until the last interval
	- Does removing Birthday Candles remove the buff?
- fix Rocky Taffy with Transcendence
- Crysotope and Frisbee are disabled when gaining certain buffs (i.e. hunter's harpoon)
- Use heal fraction for percent heals
- Koala does nothing if player doesn't have one shot protection enabled?
- Sue's Mandibles has no warning
- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)
- Yield Sign can reduce your speed when using speed mode (because displacement greater than max speed)
- change Yield Attack from will o' wisp to blast attack
- If jumping with Crysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
- RockyTaffy's Shield doesn't contribute to Transcendence
- What happens with pickups if you die after gravitating pickup?
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add VFX:
	- Add visual affect for treads triggering (extra items and snap)
	- Add visual and audio effect for picking up and using grapes
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
		- When triggered
	- Ice Cubes
		- When activated
	- Pot of Regolith
		- When activated
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
		- When blocked
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
		- When running out
	- RAM
		- When gaining 4 stacks and at max stacks
	- CremeBrulee
		- When healing
	- RottenBones
		- When increasing
	- Jealous Foe
		- Drowsy (Collecting effect)
		- Awake (A wave upon each activation)
		- Sleeping (???)
	- Pigspork
		- While you have the buff
	- Rocky Taffy
		- Granting barrier should have an effect and sound
		- Recharging buff
	- Dried Ham
		- Hitting enemy
	- Add Toy Robot radius, and other radius effects
	- Birthday Candles
		- Losing stacks

- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- HMT with Shared Design (Perfect Elite) causes infinte loop?
- Downloaded RAM and Jealous Foe will not synergize with buff duration increase as they don't use addTimedBuff


	Options for Code:
- Pigs spork and Trancedence (does it trigger low health?)
	- Might need: "this.IsHealthBelowThreshold(this.health - num14, 0.25f)"
