	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Should Grape drop chance be affected by luck, or the whole item be unaffected by luck?
- Relating to Warped Echo
	- Should Grapes / Koala / Silver Thread work only for the delayed damage and not the initial damage?
		- Koala is kind of useless because would need way too many for it to ever matter in a normal game
		- Grapes would drain faster because more chances is less grapes
		- Silver Thread would be deadlier as more smaller chances is deadlier than a single chance
		- Medkit only triggers on first hit of delayed damage
		- 
- Should Scissors cut Tonic Affliction?
- Should Yield Sign activate with Bottled Choas?


	Check Interaction:
- Should Dream Fuel use amuptated Max Health (how does it interact with the Shine of Soul)
- Use delayedDamageRefreshTime for Downloaded RAM like Chronic Expansion? (what does Chronic Expansion use?)
- Pigs spork and Trancedence (does it trigger low health?)
	- Might need: "this.IsHealthBelowThreshold(this.health - num14, 0.25f)"
- Test Pot of Regolith's damage (halved by self damage?)

	When Testing:
- Test Tiny Igloo with Turrets
- Change Icecubes to be set to 75% barrier? (Test with Gesture of the Drowned)
- Test DamageType for Macrosiesmograph
- Test if Birthday Candles and Rotten Bones works when time is frozen...
	- Because using Run.instance.time
- Check that Mythrixs can apply starve


	My Item Add Order:
- Pig's Spork
- Quantum Peel
- Grapevine
- Silver Thread
- Koala Sticker
- Tiny Igloo
- Plutotarium

	When updating mod check:
- Bugs / Tests
- Version number (Ultitems Main / Manifest)
- Readme
- Update DLL and Bundle
- Update Manifest dependencies
- Has the tags: Mods | Items | Survivors of the Void | Seekers of the Storm Update


	For Future Consideration:
- Make Obsolute and Igloo list read only?
- Crysotope and Frisbee are disabled when gaining certain buffs (i.e. hunter's harpoon)
- Use heal fraction for percent heals
- Koala does nothing if player doesn't have one shot protection enabled?
- Sue's Mandibles has no warning
- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)
- Yield Sign can reduce your speed when using speed mode (because displacement greater than max speed)
- change Yield Attack from will o' wisp to blast attack
- If jumping with Crysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
- RockyTaffy's Shield doesn't contribute to Transcendence
- What happens with pickups if you die after gravitating pickup?
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add VFX:
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
	- Ice Cubes
	- Pot of Regolith
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
	- RAM
	- CremeBrulee
	- RottenBones
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- HMT with Shared Design (Perfect Elite) causes infinte loop?
- Downloaded RAM and Jealous Foe will not synergize with buff duration increase as they don't use addTimedBuff
