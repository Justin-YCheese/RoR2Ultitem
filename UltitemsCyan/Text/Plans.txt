	
	When Testing:
- Test DamageType for Macrosiesmograph
- Test if Birthday Candles and Rotten Bones works when time is frozen...
	- Because using Run.instance.time
- Test healing removing stacks of Peel

	My Item Add Order:
- Power Chips
- Trebuchet
- Jelly Jail
- Worm Holes
- Tipped Arrow
- Tungston Rod

	When updating mod check:
- Bugs / Tests
- Version number (Ultitems Main / Manifest)
- Readme
- Change Log
- Update DLL
- Update Bundle
- Has the tags: Mods | Items | Survivors of the Void
- Check directory of zip so that manifest is the first thing


	For Future Consideration:
- Crysotope and Frisbee are disabled when gaining certain buffs (i.e. hunter's harpoon)
- Use heal fraction for percent heals
- Koala does nothing if player doesn't have one shot protection enabled?
- Sue's Mandibles has no warning
- remove public static ExpansionDef sotvDLC;
- Optimize SonorousPail by using indexing arrays
- Add DLC required to void items (Void items can still be obtained with dlc disabled?)
- Yield Sign can reduce your speed when using speed mode (because displacement greater than max speed)
- change Yield Attack from will o' wisp to blast attack
- If jumping with Crysotope the frame of landing? then infinite buff? with frisbee too?
- RockyTaffy's Shield doesn't contribute to Transcendence
- What happens with pickups if you die after gravitating pickup?
- Universal Solute
	- When disolving all available red items, doesn't replace with solvent (because of Microbots?)
	- Add transform notification when picking up a dissolved item?
- Sonorous Server Client differences?
	- Visual Glitch with Blizzard (I picked up sonorous pail while haveing blizzard up)
	- Getting Bands may not work?
- Add VFX:
	- Ultraviolet Bulb
	- Ice Cubes
	- Pot of Regolith
	- Koala Sticker (Damage Color, VFX)
	- Sues Mandibles (Warning Effect)
	- RAM
	- CremeBrulee
	- RottenBones
- Change Fleabag and Grape orb color
- Add Support for Simulacrum
- Silver Thread still activating cauldron fireworks if have normal amount of items but not new cost
- Add actual proc chain accountability for items?
- HMT with Shared Design (Perfect Elite) causes infinte loop?
- Downloaded RAM and Jealous Foe will not synergize with buff duration increase as they don't use addTimedBuff


	Ask my Friends Questions:
- Should Grape drop chance be affected by luck, or the whole item be unaffected by luck?
- Should Scissors cut Tonic Affliction?
- Should Yield Sign activate with Bottled Choas?
- What should I do with Dried Ham?
