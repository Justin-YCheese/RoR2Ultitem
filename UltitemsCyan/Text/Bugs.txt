Test:

















Fixed:
- var list = ItemCatalog.tier1ItemList;
	- Rusted Vault would never give the same white item within a run. Editing list would change ItemCatalog.tier1ItemList
	- So instead of making a copy of the list reference, I made a seperate duplicate which won't affect ItemCatalog.tier1ItemList
	- Also need to set ItemIndex to length of White Item Tiers "ItemIndex[] allWhiteItems = new ItemIndex[ItemCatalog.tier1ItemList.Count];"
- Birthday Candles disabling Shrine of Blood and other damaging structures
	- Fixed this by reworking how the damage buff was applied. Instead of upon a target taking damage and checking the attacker,
      I simply increase the attaker's stats with RecalculateStatsAPI_GetStatCoefficients while they have the buff
- Viral Smog detecting 96 status effects (because of Birthday Candles?)
	- It seems that while "sender.activeBuffsListCount" will corectly return how many statuses a player has active,
	  "sender.activeBuffsList" will return the active buffs but also be of length for every status effect then fill
	  that length with the most recent status defined. Which is why with 93 base status effect and then defining my
	  own 3 status effects, in the testing it can correct say if I have just dream speed, but then says I have 95
	  other birthday candle buffs.
	- So I used "sender.activeBuffsListCount" as the effective length of "sender.activeBuffsList" and it worked
- Birthday Candles in Multiplayer
	- Cannot pick up / On trying to pick up gain buff every frame
	- Finding the player that picked up the item was causing bugs
	- Fixed by using a better method to find who picked up the item. Instead of a foreach loop using PlayerCharacterMasterController.instances and checking if the instance's inventory
	  matched the current inventory, used "CharacterBody player = CharacterBody.readOnlyInstancesList.ToList().Find((CharacterBody body2) => body2.inventory == self);" instead
- Immune to non enemy damage
	- I didn't update damage (with orig) after checking if the damage was from a player in Birthday Buff
