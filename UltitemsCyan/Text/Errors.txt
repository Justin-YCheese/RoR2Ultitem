Error	CS0012	The type 'MonoBehaviour' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'UnityEngine, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.

    I had updated the Unity Modle Package which was a big mistake




































Resolved:

[Warning: Unity Log] RoR2.ItemTierDef must be instantiated using the ScriptableObject.CreateInstance method instead of new ItemTierDef.
Trying to acess the name of the item through a method which returns the itemDef.name parameter, but error caused.
    Resolved to just keep track with a different variable for now...


[Error  :R2API.Items] Custom item 'Faulty Bulb' is not XMLsafe. Item not added.
Adding spaces to an item's token variables may cause problems for an XML format
    So use tokens instead of standard strings, or just remove the spaces from your strings


[Error  : Unity Log] ItemDef 'EXAMPLE_ITEM_NAME' has an item index of 'None'.  Attempting to fix...
I had set my Itemdef to protected which meant the neccesary API couldn't read the item data.
This made one item have funtionality of all the items and all the other items did nothing.
    So set item definition to public.
    I'm still getting the same error, but I think the index is set after startup


[Debug  :UltitemsCyan] Buffs Done
[Error  : Unity Log] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
    Stack trace:
    UltitemsCyan.Ultitems.Awake () (at <2180890ba7604f259a43d930384819da>:IL_005B)
    UnityEngine.GameObject:AddComponent(Type)
    BepInEx.Bootstrap.Chainloader:Start()
    FlashWindow:.cctor()
The program kept crashing right before running the init for items
    It seemse it's because of this line: Log.Debug("Adding " + newItem.item.name);
    Which tries to access the item definition's name but can't for some reason even though it's public and in the base class

    Can't use shrine of blood?
    Fixed this by reworking how the damage buff was applied. Instead of upon a target taking damage and checking the attacker,
    I simply increase the attaker's stats with RecalculateStatsAPI_GetStatCoefficients
